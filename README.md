# ALX - Simple Shell Project

A project to code a simple shell that replicates the basic functionality of a Linux shell.

### How to Install
Compile the code like so:
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```
This will cause all warnings to act as compilation errors and will name the executable file hsh.

## Usage
Run like so:
```
./hsh
```
The shell can accept commands, which should be given like so:
```
$ command [args ...]
```
